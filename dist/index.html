        <h1><span class="text-secondary">JP Morgan Hackathon</span></h1>
        <p>
          In 2018, I competed in JP Morgan's Code for Good hackathon that
          involved creating an app for two local non-profits in the Delaware
          area. I, along with 5 other teammates, created a responsive web app
          for Good Will of Delaware to help them increase cash donations and
          find creative ways to thank their donors. Using the
          <span class="text-secondary">Ionic</span> framework, I mostly worked
          on the front end and designed the application to encourage donations
          through gamification and also be very user friendly for all age
          groups. I had a fun time learning how to use the
          <span class="text-secondary">Ionic</span> framework and also using
          <span class="text-secondary">Sass</span> and
          <span class="text-secondary">TypeScript</span> to style the app.
          After staying up for over 30 hours straight we presented in front of
          10 JP Morgan senior executives and actually ended up winning the
          whole competition!

        <p>
          Probably the coolest out of all my projects, is a smart mirror that
          I am making after winning a few of the materials at a hackathon.
          Using an old monitor I had, a
          <span class="text-secondary">Raspberry Pi</span>, and lots of
          YouTube videos I made a cool customizable smart mirror for my
          friend's 21st birthday gift. Along with that the mirror can be
          activated using a
          <span class="text-secondary">Google Home Mini</span> I also won at a
          hackathon. In terms of hardware this was hard as hell for me since I
          have no knowledge of how circuits worked and also never used a power
          saw before. Software wise, it is pretty much just this video

        <h1><span class="text-secondary">Personal Website</span></h1>
        <p>
          This portfolio website is actually the first side project I have
          ever completed so it is quite the milestone for me. Following my
          favorite tutorial YouTuber, Traversy Media, I learned the basics of
          <span class="text-secondary">Sass</span> and how great of an editor
          <span class="text-secondary">VS Code</span> is. This project was
          made using good old <span class="text-secondary">HTML</span> and
          <span class="text-secondary">JavaScript</span>, mixed with Sass.
          Along with the basic static information, I added the
          <span class="text-secondary">particles.js</span> library to create
          the front page. For the animations, I used <span class="text-secondary">animate.css</span> and <span class="text-secondary">wow.js</span> to make the animations be played once the user scrolls it an element. The most annoying part was definitely making the
          whole website was responsive because I knew most of my friends would
          look at this on their phone. Aside from that, I also learned how to
          use <span class="text-secondary">Github</span> properly too.
