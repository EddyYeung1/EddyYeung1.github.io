          <h1><span class="text-secondary">JP Morgan Hackathon</span></h1>
          <p>
            In 2018, I competed in JP Morgan's Code for Good hackathon that
            involved creating an app for two local non-profits in the Delaware
            area. I, along with 5 other teammates, created a responsive web app
            for Good Will of Delaware to help them increase cash donations and
            find creative ways to thank their donors. Using the
            <span class="text-secondary">Ionic</span> framework, I mostly worked
            on the front end and designed the application to encourage donations
            through gamification and also be very user friendly to all age
            groups to use. I had a fun time learning how to use the
            <span class="text-secondary">Ionic</span> framework and also using
            <span class="text-secondary">Sass</span> and
            <span class="text-secondary">TypeScript</span> to style the app.
            After staying up for over 30 hours straight we presented in front of
            10 JP Morgan senior executives and actually ended up winning the
            whole competition!

          <h1><span class="text-secondary">Smart Mirror</span></h1>
          <p>
            Probably the coolest out of all my projects, is a smart mirror that
            I am making after winning a few of the materials at a hackathon.
            Using an old monitor I had, a
            <span class="text-secondary">Raspberry Pi</span>, and lots of
            youtube videos I made a cool customizable smart mirror for my
            friend's 21st birthday gift. Along with that the mirror can be
            activated using a
            <span class="text-secondary">Google Home Mini</span> I also won at a
            hackathon. In terms of hardware this was hard as hell for me since I
            have no knowledge of how circuits worked and also never used a power
            saw before. Software wise, it is pretty much just this video

              >right here</a
            >. I will be posting a YouTube video of the whole process, so stay
            tuned for that!

          <h1><span class="text-secondary">Personal Website</span></h1>
          <p>
            This portfolio website is actually the first side project I have
            ever completed so it is quite the milestone for me. Following my
            favorite tutorial YouTuber, Traversy Media, I learned the basics of
            <span class="text-secondary">Sass</span> and how great of an editor
            <span class="text-secondary">VS Code</span> is. This project was
            made using good old <span class="text-secondary">HTML</span> and
            <span class="text-secondary">JavaScript</span>, mixed with Sass.
            Along with the basic static information, I added the
            <span class="text-secondary">particles.js</span> library to create
            the front page. The most annoying part was definitely making the
            whole website was responsive because I knew most of my friends would
            look at this on their phone. Aside from that, I also learned how to
            use <span class="text-secondary">Github</span> properly too.
